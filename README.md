## Business Problem and Solution
This Telco Products/Roaming Plan Recommendation Engine targets to do recommendations based on the following analysis:
1. 	Analyzing customer usage patterns
2.	Comparing available plans against customer needs
3.	Providing personalized recommendations with cost analysis
4.	Handling roaming plan queries for international travelers

## Solution Architecture
The Recommendation Engine is built with a multi-agent system and the system consists with the following parts:
1.	Triage Agent: Routes customer requests to appropriate specialists
2.	Plan Recommendation Agent: Analyzes needs and recommends optimal plans
3.	Roaming Specialist Agent: Handles international roaming queries
4.	Customer Profile Tool: Retrieves customer data and usage history
5.	Plan Comparison Tool: Compares plans against customer requirements
6.	RAG Pipeline: Provides context from telco knowledge base

## Setup and Configuration

### Environment Setup
First step is to create and activate the virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv telco_agent_env
source telco_agent_env/bin/activate
```
### Install Dependencies
Then install required packages
```bash
pip install openai-agents
pip install fastapi uvicorn
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install pandas numpy
pip install langchain langchain-community
pip install chromadb
pip install python-dotenv
pip install pydantic
```
### Environment Configuration
Next step is to create a .env file which contains:
```YAML
OPENAI_API_KEY= your-openai-api-key
TELCO_DB_PATH=/PATH/TO/telco_agent_env/data/telco_knowledge_base
VECTOR_DB_PATH=/PATH/TO/telco_agent_env/data/vector_store
```
You can create your openai secrete key and replace 'your-openai-api-key' with it.

## Customer Agent and Tool
Based on the business problem, I created folder ``Customer Agent`` which includes the following scripts:

``models.py``: It defines the models for representing customer profiles, usage patterns, plans, and recommendations in a telecommunications context, facilitating structured handling and analysis of user and plan data.

``mock_data.py``: It creates mock data for telecom plans, customer profiles, usage patterns, and knowledge base documents to facilitate testing and development of telecom-related applications.

``tools.py``: It creates function modules that performs specific tasks: retrieving customer profiles, analyzing plan suitabilities, etc.

``agents.py``: It creates agents objects that hold a list of tool objects.

``main.py``: It stimulates responses based on user input by detecting intent.

## Customer Agent and Tool Integration Method
The integration method is by the agent calling tool functions at runtime, passing user inputs, and integrating results into its responses. Here are the explanations:
1. The agent (e.g., a chatbot) receives a user query.
2. It detects or is explicitly instructed to call specific tools based on the query content.
3. The agent invokes the respective tools (tool.run() or similar methods) with appropriate inputs.
4. The tools return data (like customer profile or knowledge snippets).
5. The agent uses these inputs to compose a natural response or decide further actions.

## RAG Pipeline
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  pipeline is used to retrieve relevant factual information from knowledge base to ground responses. I created folder ``RAG`` which includes the following scripts:

``RAG_pipeline``: It defines RAG pipeline that encodes knowledge base documents into vectors, builds a FAISS similarity index for fast retrieval, and provides methods to retrieve and format relevant documents based on user queries.

``RAG_implement``: It uses my mocked knowledge base to ground the agent's reposnese.

## Methods to Fine Tune RAG Pipeline 
1. Refine Retrievel Strategy: I plan to experiment with different top_k (like 5 or 10) to ensure relevant info isn't missed. I can also combine multiple retrievals or rerank top results using a small-language model or heuristic.
2. Enhance Context Formatting: I plan to add metadata lables like categories or tages to help the language model differentiate sources.
3. Leverage Hybrid Approaches: I plan to combine retrieval with heuristic rules and use prompt engineering to structure the context with explicit prompts.

## Integration Strategy and Approach
### Deployment methods for the agent in an enterprise telco environment
1. WhatsApp: Leverage Twilio or WhatsApp Business API to integrate the agent. This involves setting up webhooks to receive messages and respond via the agent's logic.
2. Microsoft Teams: Use Microsoft Bot Framework to deploy the agent within Teams. Create a bot service that listens to conversations and routes them through the agent for processing.
3. Web Portal: Embed the agent in the customer web portal using a frontend framework (React, Angular). Use JavaScript or WebSockets to handle real-time interactions, routing requests through a backend API that interfaces with the agent.

### Anticipated practical integration challenges
1. Authentication. Solutions include secure API endpoints with OAuth2 or JWTs to ensure only authenticated users can access services and implementing two-factor authentication for sensitive actions using SMS or email verification.
2. Latency. To minimize latency, we can deploy the agent in proximity to the user base using CDNs or regional cloud servers, or optimize data processing and retrieval by precomputing frequent queries and responses.
3. UI Design. We can use conversational UI/UX principles ensuring clarity, easy navigation, and feedback mechanisms for incomplete requests.
4. Scalability. The recommendation engine can be deployed on cloud platforms for auto-scaling capabilities and use microservices arechitecture for modularity.

### Metrics to evaluate agent performance and value in a production environment
1. Response Accuracy and Relevance
2. Response Time
3. Customer Satisfaction Score
4. Customer Engagement Rate
5. Customer Retention Rate
